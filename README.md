## Prompt

### De-Mystifying ML

1. Find a Problem worth Solving, Analyzing, or Visualizing

2. Use ML in the context of technologies learned

3. You must use:

    * Sci-Kit Learn and/or another machine learning library

4. You must use at least two of the below

    * Python Pandas

    * Python Matplotlib

    * Python Tweepy

    * Python Flask

    * HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

    * JavaScript Plotly

    * Javascript D3.js

    * JavaScript Leaflet

    * MySQL Database

    * MongoDB Database

    * Google Cloud SQL

    * Tableau

5. Prepare a 15 minute “data deep dive” or “infrastructure walkthrough” that shows machine learning the context of what we’ve already learned.

6. Example Projects:

    * Create a Front-End Interface that Maps to an API to “Smarten” the Algorithm

    * Perform a Deep Dive of Existing Data Using Machine Learning 

    * Create a Visualization that Continues to “Learn” Where Clusters Lie Based on ML (Use D3 or Plotly to Change the Visualization)

    * Create an idea with “mock data” that simulates how machine learning might be used

    * Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression
